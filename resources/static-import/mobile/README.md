# Mobile Design Files

## Upload Instructions

Please upload the following files exported from your mobile PSD design:

### Required Files:
1. **index.html** - The HTML structure for the mobile version
2. **style.css** - The CSS styles for the mobile version
3. **images/** - All image assets for the mobile version (place them in the `images/` subfolder)

### File Structure:
```
mobile/
├── index.html          ← Upload your mobile HTML here
├── style.css           ← Upload your mobile CSS here
└── images/             ← Upload all mobile images here
    ├── logo.png
    ├── background.jpg
    └── ... (all other mobile images)
```

### Notes:
- The mobile design will be automatically applied when users access the site on mobile devices (phones)
- Tablet designs can also be included - I'll create responsive breakpoints for:
  - Mobile: < 768px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1024px  
  - Desktop: > 1024px
- If you have separate tablet designs, you can also create a `tablet/` folder with the same structure

Once you upload these files, I'll integrate them into the responsive landing page system.
